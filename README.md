## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ann Marie

### USU Computer Science | Fall 2024

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a web game inspired by Little Alchemy and my recreational love of geology. Some of my other favorite projects:

- [Medication Tracker](https://github.com/annmarie2/meds_tracker) - A Flutter project that keeps track of medications. It will alert you when a medication needs to be taken. The alarm setting can be toggled on or off.
- [Lundar Lander](https://github.com/annmarie2/LunarLander) - A JS take on the classic Lunar Lander game genre.

ðŸ¤” Perpetually pondering the etymological significance of programming language names (Rust, Ruby on Rails, Python, Go, Java, Swift)

ðŸ‘¯ Very interested in how people think about tech and where those conceptualizations come from
